### Project Summary

**Multi-Container Infrastructure Setup using Docker and Docker Compose**

- Developed a robust multi-container architecture within a virtual machine to host various services.
- Created custom Dockerfiles for each service, ensuring images were built locally without using pre-built images (except for Alpine and Debian).
- Configured essential services, including NGINX (with TLSv1.2 or TLSv1.3), WordPress with PHP-FPM, and MariaDB, managing their interactions through a dedicated Docker network.
- Implemented persistent storage using Docker volumes for the WordPress database and website files.
- Established automatic restart policies for containers to ensure high availability and resilience.
- Configured a custom domain to point to the local IP address, enhancing accessibility.
- Prioritized best practices in Docker container management, focusing on security, isolation, and performance.

This project demonstrates strong skills in containerization, infrastructure management, and adherence to best practices in software development.
